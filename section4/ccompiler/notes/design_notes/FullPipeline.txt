I have moved over to this file for notes.
You know what, I think I am going to check in what I have for now.
I think there are already a lot of changes.
I just found out about git difftool and vimdiff.
That shit is awesome.
I like it.
The colors are dumb for now, but the tools are cool, and I am going to use them.
I can configure the colors to be more helpful some time, anyways.
