There are separate name spaces for various categories of identifiers, as follows:
 - label names (disambiguated by the syntax of the label declaration syntax and use)
 - tags of structures, unions, and enumerations (disambiguated by following any of the keywords struct, union, or enum)
 - members of structures or unions; each struct or union has a separate name space for its members (disambiguated by the type of the expression used to access the member via the . or -> operator)
 - all other identifiers, called ordinary identifiers (declared in ordinary declarators or as enumeration constants)
