I'd like to be able to use ghci or ghc when I build parsers.
I'd like to be able to build small sections of the project as well as the
    project as a whole.
I demand a way to clean up all .o and .hi files generated from ghc.


I think I will have a Makefile per directory with Haskell modules.
At the time of writing, I have soft links pointing to directories that I want to include
    in the -i argument (see "Finding imports" in ghc man page).
In each directory's Makefile, I could specify a variable that holds the 
    directories to add to the import path.
I think I'm going to use a bin folder to hold all object files.
Fuck using make for ghci.
I don't need to do that.
I can just add directories with the -i CLA for ghci.
I just checked the /bin/ directory on my box.
There were no directories nor symlinks to directories.
I guess I will do the same thing for my bin folder for the compiler.

I think I may take a simpler approach.
I think I will take each package and put them all in one folder.
That folder will have one make file.
Each package will have its own makefile.
The makefiles will reference other packages by simply adding -i../ CLA
    to ghc when they build a module.
There will be one single bin directory inside the directory holding 
    all the different haskell packages.
