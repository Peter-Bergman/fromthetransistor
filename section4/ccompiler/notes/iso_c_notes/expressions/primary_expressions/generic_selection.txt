        ----------------------------- Generic Selection ------------------------------------

generic-selection:
	_Generic ( assignment-expression , generic-assoc-list )
generic-assoc-list:
	generic-association
	generic-assoc-list , generic-association
generic-association:
	type-name : assignment-expression
	default : assignment-expression


           ------------------------------ Constraints --------------------------

A generic selection shall have no more than one default generic association.
The type name in a generic association shall specify a complete object type other than a variably modified type.
No two generic associations in the same generic selection shall specify compatible types.
The controlling expression of a generic selection shall have type compatible with at most one of the types named in its generic association list.
If a generic selection has no default generic association, its controlling expression shall have type compatible with exactly one of the types named in its generic association list.

           ---------------------------- Semantics --------------------------------

The controlling expression of a generic selection is not evaluated. 
If a generic selection has a generic association with a type name that is compatible with the type of the controlling expression, then the result expression of the generic selection is the expression in that generic association.
Otherwise, the result expression of the generic selection is the expression in the default generic association.
None of the expressions from any other generic association of the generic selection evaluated. 

The type and value of a generic selection are identical to those of its result expression.
It is an lvalue, a function designator, or a void expression if its result expression is, respectively, an lvalue, a function designator, or a void expression.
