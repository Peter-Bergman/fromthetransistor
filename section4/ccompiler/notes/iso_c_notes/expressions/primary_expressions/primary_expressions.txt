An identifier is a primary expression, provided it has been declared as designating an object (in which case it is an lvalue) or a function (in which case it is a function designator).

A constant is a primary expression. Its type depends on its form and value, as detailed in 6.4.4.

A string literal is a primary expression. It is an lvalue with type as detailed in 6.4.5.

A parenthesized expression is a primary expression.
Its type and value are identical to those of the unparenthesized expression.
It is an lvalue, a function designator, or a void expression if the unparenthesized expression is, respectively, an lvalue, a function designator, or a void expression.

A generic selection is a primary expression.
Its type and value depend on the selected generic association, as detailed in the following subclause.
