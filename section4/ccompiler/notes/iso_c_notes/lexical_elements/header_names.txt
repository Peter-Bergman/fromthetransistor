              Header names

         ----------- Syntax ------------

header-name:

	" q-char-sequence "
h-char-sequence:
	h-char
	h-char-sequence h-char
h-char:
	any member of the source character set except the new-line character and >
q-char-sequence:
	q-char
	q-char-sequence q-char
q-char:
	any member of the source character set except the new-line character and "

       -------------- Semantics --------------

The sequence in both forms of header names are mapped in an implementation-defined manner to headers or external source file names as specified in 6.10.2.

If the characters ',\,",//, or \* occur in the sequence between the < and > delimiters, the behavior is undefined. Similarly, if the characters ', \, //, or /* occur in the sequence between the " delimiters, the behavior is undefined. Header name preprocessing tokens are recognized only within #include preprocessing directives and in implementation-defined locations within #pragma directives.
