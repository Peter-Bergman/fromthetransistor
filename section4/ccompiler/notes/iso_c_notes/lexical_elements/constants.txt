              Constants

          ----------- Syntax ----------------

constant:
	integer-constant
	floating-constant
	enumeration-constant
	character-constant

         -------------- Constraints --------------

Each constant shall have a type and the value of a constant shall be in the range of representable values for its type.

           ---------- Semantics ----------

... I don't feel like writing all of this up now ...

There is also syntax for each of these types of constants. Maybe some other time. Not feeling it now. I don't think it's necessarry.
