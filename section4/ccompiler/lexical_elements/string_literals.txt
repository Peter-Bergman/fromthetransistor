		String Literals

           ----------- Syntax ------------

string-literal:
	encoding-prefix(opt) " s-char-sequence(opt) "
encoding-prefix:
	u8
	u
	U
	L
s-char-sequence:
	s-char
	s-char-sequence s-char
s-char:
	any member of the source character set except the double-quote ", backslash \, or new-line character
	escape-sequence

          ------------ Constraints ---------------

A sequence of adjacent string literal tokens shall not include both a wide string literal and a UTF-8 string literal.

           ---------- Description -----------

A character string literal is a sequence of zero or more multibyte characters enclosed in double-quotes, as in "xyz". A UTF-8 string literal is the same, except prefixed by u8. 
A wide string literal is the same, except prefixed by the letter L, u, or U.

The same considerations apply to each element of the sequence in a string literal as if it were in an integer character constant (for a character or UTF-8 string literal) or a wide character constant (for a wide string literal), except that the single-quote ' is representable either by itself or by the escape sequence \', but the double-quote " shall be represented by the escape sequence \".

          ----------- Semantics -------------

{- I don't feel like writing out the semantics right now. My left hand hurts from typing. Give me a break, sheesh. I'm just gonna move on and come back if needed. -}
